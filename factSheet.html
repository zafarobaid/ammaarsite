    <h5>Abiotic factors and the adaptations organisms have to deal with them</h5>
    <p>The first abiotic factor that marine organisms in the epipelagic zone have to cope with is water. One adaptation is gills, which help them breathe in their habitat. Another adaptation is flippers and fins, which help with movement and allow for easy swimming. The second abiotic factor is sunlight availibility. In the epipelagic zone, sunlight is abundant. Therefore, most organims have good eyesight. Also, plants and phytoplankton can photosynthesis. The third abiotic factor is temperature. As the epipelagic zone is near the surface, the temperature is mild, slightly warm but not too much so, and slightly cold but not extensively. this means that organisms from the deep, where it is very cold, would not be able to live in the epipelagic zone. A fourth abiotic factor is pressure. Again, being near the surface means that there is little pressure, which in turn means that organisms from deeper zones would not survive in the epipelagic.</p>

    <h5>Symbiotic relationships</h5>
    <p>Symbiotic relationships can be found throuought the animal world. Here are a few which occur in the epipelagic zone. The first is between the remora and the shark. Remoras attach themselves to sharks' bellies, where they find food and shelter. The shark does not benefit from this, but does not suffer either, making this a form of commensalism. The second is that of the cleaner fish and grouper. In this relationship, the cleaner fish gets a free meal and the grouper gets its teeth cleaned; both benefit from the arrangement. Therefore, this relationship is a form of mutualism. The third symbiotic relationship is that of the tongue louse isopod and the snapper. The louse first eats the snappers tongue, then gets the first bite of everything the snapper eats. In this relationship, the louse benefits while he snapper suffers. This means that the relationship is a form of parasitism, in which the louse is the parasite and the snapper is the host.</p>
